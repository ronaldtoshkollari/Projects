# Distributed Systems

This project was quite interesting. We had to create both back-end and font-end of an Android Application. The app was a clone of Spotify. We used Publisher-Broker-Consumer architecture. We have 2 publishers and two brokers in order to get better performance. Threads and sockets are also used.

Bellow are some examples of our UI of the application.
