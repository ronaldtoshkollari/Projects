# Databases

The project here was quite realistic as we had to create create, update and maintain a real database with millions of records of Airbnb customers.

Bellow we are going to see how the schema of our database has changed in order to fit new data every time.

The next project was quite big as we had to edit our CSV files with python in order to find duplicates, null values etc. 

The report of the project is [here](https://github.com/roni3840/Projects/blob/master/Databases(SQL-Python)/Project-Python/partA/Report.pdf).
