# Analysis-And-Design-Of-Information-Systems
---
- First project, we had to find system requirements of a use case.

  Example

- In our second project we had to categorize each systems requirements by category.

  Example

  <img src="C:\Users\Roni\Desktop\Everything\MyProjects\Analysis-And-Design-Of-Information-Systems\img\Screenshot_2.png" alt="Screenshot_2" style="zoom:80%;" />

- The third project we had to create framework diagram for each use case.

  Example

  <img src="C:\Users\Roni\Desktop\Everything\MyProjects\Analysis-And-Design-Of-Information-Systems\img\Screenshot_3.png" alt="Screenshot_3" style="zoom:80%;" />

- In this project we created ER diagrams for every use case.

  Example

  <img src="C:\Users\Roni\Desktop\Everything\MyProjects\Analysis-And-Design-Of-Information-Systems\img\Screenshot_4.png" alt="Screenshot_4" style="zoom:80%;" />

- Our next project was to combine our two previous projects in order to complete a full system design(ER+framework diagram)

  Examples

  <img src="C:\Users\Roni\Desktop\Everything\MyProjects\Analysis-And-Design-Of-Information-Systems\img\Screenshot_5.png" alt="Screenshot_5" style="zoom:80%;" />

  <img src="C:\Users\Roni\Desktop\Everything\MyProjects\Analysis-And-Design-Of-Information-Systems\img\Screenshot_6.png" alt="Screenshot_6" style="zoom:80%;" />

- The next project we had to understand the usage of UML and create a new one for the previous project

  <img src="C:\Users\Roni\Desktop\Everything\MyProjects\Analysis-And-Design-Of-Information-Systems\img\Screenshot_7.png" alt="Screenshot_7" style="zoom:80%;" />

- This project has to do with UX and our goal was to create an user friendly mock-up

  ![Screenshot_9](C:\Users\Roni\Desktop\Everything\MyProjects\Analysis-And-Design-Of-Information-Systems\img\Screenshot_9.png)

- Our final project had to do with time management of a project in total

  Example
